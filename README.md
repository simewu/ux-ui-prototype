# User-eXperience / User-Interface project using Axure
Axure is a wireframe and prototyping tool for the development of interactive user interfaces that can be later implemented into a real application. For this project, the assignment was to create a food ordering application that users can interact with to perform a variety of tasks. The tasks were graded solely on the overall user experience and design principles applied when using the application.

Gestalt design principles include:
- Perception
- Proximity
- Similarity
- Hierarchy
- Contrast
- Dominance
- Unity
